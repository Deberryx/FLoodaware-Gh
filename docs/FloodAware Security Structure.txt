## **Security Structure for FloodAware GH**

**Prepared by:** Terry
**Date:** 2025-05-23
**Version:** 1.0

---

### **1. Core Security Principles**

* **Confidentiality:** Only authorized users and systems can access sensitive data.
* **Integrity:** Data remains unaltered except through authorized actions.
* **Availability:** Services must remain available during emergencies like floods.
* **Privacy:** Comply with data protection best practices (align with Ghana Data Protection Act).

---

### **2. Authentication & Access Control**

#### a. **User Authentication**

* Firebase Auth (or AWS Cognito):

  * OTP-based login (phone/email)
  * OAuth for Google Sign-in
* All sessions use **JWT tokens** with expiry (e.g., 1 hour + refresh token)

#### b. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

| **Role**  | **Permissions**                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| User      | Submit/view tags, receive alerts      |
| Moderator | Approve/delete flood tags, flag abuse |
| Admin     | Full access: users, alerts, analytics |

---

### **3. Data Security**

#### a. **Data in Transit**

* All data transmitted over **HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or higher)**
* Firebase or AWS SDKs with secure headers

#### b. **Data at Rest**

* Cloud Firestore/Database encryption
* Images stored in **encrypted buckets**
* Location data anonymized if used for analytics

#### c. **On Device (Offline Mode)**

* Local data stored in **encrypted SQLite DB**
* Auto-wipe option after sync or inactivity

---

### **4. Infrastructure Security**

* **Firewall Rules:** Limit access to backend services only from app IPs or cloud functions
* **WAF/CDN (Cloudflare or AWS Shield):** Protect against DDoS, injection, and bad bots
* **Environment Isolation:** Separate dev, test, and production environments

---

### **5. Input Validation & Abuse Prevention**

* Sanitize all user inputs (text/comments) to prevent injection
* Rate limiting: throttle endpoints like `/tag`, `/login`
* Image size and format validation
* AI checks to detect spam or unrealistic tag patterns (e.g., daily floods from same user)

---

### **6. Logging & Auditing**

* Track actions: tag creation, approvals, logins
* Audit logs for moderator/admin actions (with timestamps and IP)
* Alert on suspicious patterns (e.g., mass uploads, repeated failures)

---

### **7. User Privacy Controls**

* Allow users to:

  * View/delete their data
  * Opt out of location tracking
  * Disable notifications
* Terms & Conditions + Privacy Policy shown at sign-up

---

### **8. Disaster Recovery & Backups**

* **Daily backups** of user data, tags, and risk predictions
* Backup stored in separate, secure region
* Recovery plan tested quarterly

---

### **9. Compliance and Legal**

* Ghana Data Protection Act compliance
* Optional: GDPR alignment for future international expansion
* Partner with local data privacy consultant (for review)

---

### **10. Future Enhancements**

* Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
* Biometric login
* AI-based fraud detection
* Encryption key rotation policies
