**Product Requirements Document (PRD)**
**Product Name:** FloodAware GH
**Prepared by:** \[Terry]
**Date:** \[2025-05-23]
**Version:** 1.0

---

### **1. Objective**

FloodAware GH is a mobile app designed to empower residents of Ghana to tag and monitor flood-prone areas, measure flood levels in a user-friendly way, and receive AI-driven early warnings and preparedness tips. The app leverages local user data, AI models, and weather APIs to promote community-level disaster awareness and response during the rainy season.

---

### **2. Goals**

* Enable users to **tag flood-prone areas** using geolocation and photo uploads.
* Allow users to **easily log water levels** using visual guides and phone sensors.
* Use **AI and weather data** to predict flood risks and **send alerts** before the rainy season.
* Provide **actionable safety tips** and preparation checklists based on risk level.
* Support **offline data capture**, syncing when online.

### **3. Key Features**

#### 3.1. User Account

* Sign up/login (email, phone number, or Google)
* Profile includes location, flood history, and preferences

#### 3.2. Flood-Prone Area Tagging

* Users tap a “Tag Flood Area” button
* Map view opens with GPS pin
* Option to add photos, water depth (with slider), and comments
* Tags reviewed by moderators or via AI validation

#### 3.3. Water Level Measurement

* User selects between:

  * Slider (ankle, knee, waist, chest, over head)
  * AR camera overlay to match height level on a wall/road object
* Option to input date, time, and location manually if offline

#### 3.4. Weather and Flood Alerts

* Integration with Weather Channel or Meteo Ghana API
* AI predicts flood likelihood using:

  * Recent user-submitted data
  * Weather forecasts
  * Topographical trends (if available)
* Push notifications 3-5 days before heavy rain events

#### 3.5. Preparation and Response Tips

* Display safety checklists (e.g., move valuables, clean drains)
* Personalized suggestions based on user’s flood tag and AI analysis

#### 3.6. Community Map & Reports

* Heatmap of high-risk areas
* Users can view tagged areas near them
* Verified alerts highlighted in red

### **4. Technical Requirements**

* **Platforms:** Android (priority), iOS
* **Back-End:** Firebase or AWS Amplify
* **AI/ML:** TensorFlow Lite / PyTorch Mobile (local + cloud inference)
* **Weather API:** Meteo Ghana, OpenWeatherMap, or Weather Channel API
* **Mapping:** Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap
* **Offline Capability:** Local storage, auto-sync when connected

---

### **5. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Accessibility:** Local language support (Akan, Ewe, Ga, Hausa)
* **Security:** OTP verification, secure storage of location data
* **Performance:** Sync under 5MB of data within 10 seconds on 3G
* **Scalability:** Handle up to 1M users and 500K flood reports
* **Reliability:** 99.5% uptime for alerts and sync

---

### **6. Metrics for Success**

* 10,000+ downloads within first 6 months
* > 80% of users opt in to flood alerts
* At least 500 community tags in first 3 months
* 90% of AI alerts are timely and actionable
* Positive feedback from at least 70% of surveyed users

---

### **7. Risks and Assumptions**

| **Risk**                                  | **Mitigation**                                         |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Inaccurate tagging by users               | Use AI and moderator review                            |
| Low smartphone penetration in rural areas | Optimize for low-end Androids, explore SMS integration |
| Data privacy concerns                     | Provide opt-out and clear privacy terms                |
| Limited weather data granularity          | Use community input to improve AI prediction accuracy  |
